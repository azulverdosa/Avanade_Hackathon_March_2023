## General Information

Bridge is a dashboard tool for a company's HR team to easily monitor their company culture in a quantitative and effective way.

The gender gap in pay has remained relatively stable in the United States over the past 20 years or so. In 2022, women earned an average of 82% of what men earned, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly earnings of both full and part-time workers. These results are similar to where the pay gap stood in 2002, when women earned 80% as much as men.

At the heart of this issue, we believe that companies could be more transparent about their hiring practices but also monitor the diversity of their employee more regularly, striving to Bridge the gap and promote fair treatment of all employees, no matter their gender or background.

## Limitations

> Currently the graphs are not dynamically generated because it took too much time to figure out out to connect an API to make requests to generate the visialise ations. The only graphs that generate are the Females at Work and Ffnance report in the favouroites list, the Work Life Balance report in the Lifestyle reports, the selected parameters of Gender+ Salary + Position will generate an image and, Gender + Position. We plan on continuing to develop the APi to be able to generate the graph dynamically.
